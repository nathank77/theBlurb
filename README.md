A text-based adventure game I created for a school project. Original story and concept by me as well.

To use this program, download the src folder and the hsa_ufa folder and run the [FullGame.java](..src/FullGame.java) class. For best performance, you will need the fonts and music files included in the source folder. See documentation or the user manual for more details on the operation and methodology behind the program.

Note that there are some bugs in the game that affect the text.
